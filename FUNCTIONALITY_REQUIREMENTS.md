# Project Functionality Requirements Documentation

## Overview

This project is a file management system that provides users with the ability to upload, organize, and manage files and folders. It includes both a client-side React application and a server-side Express.js API. The system supports user authentication, role-based access control, and file operations such as upload, rename, move, and delete.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Authentication

- **Login**: Users can log in using their email and password.
- **Signup**: New users can register with an email and password.
- **Token-based Authentication**: The system uses JWT for secure authentication.
- **Role-based Access Control**:
  - Admins have elevated privileges to manage users and files.
  - Regular users can manage their own files and folders.

### 2. File and Folder Management

- **File Upload**:
  - Users can upload files to specific folders.
  - Duplicate file names are not allowed within the same folder.
- **Folder Creation**:
  - Users can create folders within other folders.
  - Duplicate folder names are not allowed within the same parent folder.
- **File/Folder Rename**:
  - Users can rename files and folders.
- **File/Folder Move**:
  - Users can move files and folders to other folders.
  - Circular references are prevented (e.g., moving a folder into itself).
- **File/Folder Delete**:
  - Users can delete files and folders.
  - Deleting a folder removes all its contents recursively.

### 3. Admin Features

- **User Management**:
  - Admins can view all users and their roles.
  - Admins can promote, demote, or delete users.
- **File Management**:
  - Admins can view all files in the system.
  - Admins can delete any file.

### 4. Navigation and UI

- **Breadcrumb Navigation**:
  - Users can navigate through folders using breadcrumbs.
- **Sidebar**:
  - Provides quick access to "My Drive," "Shared with Me," "Recent," "Starred," and "Trash."
- **Top Navigation Bar**:
  - Displays the project title and a logout button.
- **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Displays a list of users and files for administrative actions.

### 5. Error Handling

- **Validation**:
  - Input fields are validated for required fields and correct formats.
- **Error Messages**:
  - Users are shown appropriate error messages for failed operations.
- **Fallbacks**:
  - The system handles unexpected errors gracefully.

### 6. Security

- **Environment Variables**:
  - Sensitive information like database URIs and JWT secrets are stored in environment variables.
- **Password Hashing**:
  - User passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
- **Authorization Middleware**:
  - Ensures only authorized users can access specific routes.

## Best Practices

### 1. Security Best Practices

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse
  - Set appropriate limits for file uploads and API requests
- **Input Sanitization**:
  - Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
  - Validate file types and extensions before upload
  - Implement file size limits and content-type verification
- **CORS Configuration**:
  - Configure proper CORS policies for API endpoints
  - Restrict access to trusted domains only
- **Secure Headers**:
  - Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
  - Use helmet.js middleware for Express
- **Audit Logging**:
  - Log all critical operations (file changes, user management)
  - Implement audit trails for admin actions
  - Store logs securely with proper rotation policies

### 2. Performance Optimization

- **File Handling**:
  - Implement file streaming for large files
  - Use chunked uploads for better performance
  - Compress files where appropriate
- **Caching Strategy**:
  - Implement Redis for session management
  - Cache frequently accessed files and folder structures
  - Use ETags for API responses
- **Database Optimization**:
  - Index frequently queried fields
  - Implement database connection pooling
  - Use pagination for large data sets

### 3. Code Quality

- **Testing**:
  - Maintain 80% or higher test coverage
  - Implement unit tests for all business logic
  - Include integration tests for API endpoints
  - Set up E2E testing for critical user flows
- **Documentation**:
  - Follow JSDoc standards for code documentation
  - Maintain up-to-date API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
  - Document all environment variables and configuration options
- **Code Structure**:
  - Follow SOLID principles
  - Implement proper error handling and logging
  - Use TypeScript interfaces for data models
  - Follow consistent coding style (ESLint, Prettier)

### 4. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Health Checks**:
  - Implement health check endpoints
  - Monitor system resources and performance
  - Set up automated alerts for critical issues
- **Backup Strategy**:
  - Implement automated daily backups
  - Store backups in separate geographical locations
  - Regular backup restoration testing
- **Deployment**:
  - Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
  - Implement zero-downtime deployments
  - Maintain staging environment for testing
